TrustFind – Decentralized Lost & Found System

Trustfind is a decentralized lost and found platform built on the Stacks blockchain, enabling users to securely report lost items, register found items, and claim rewards without intermediaries.
It’s like a digital lost & found box on the blockchain – transparent, secure, and immutable.

* Features

. Blockchain-Backed Records – Items registered are permanently stored on the Stacks blockchain.

. Leather Wallet Integration – Users connect via Leather Wallet to interact with the dApp.

. Immutable Transactions – Every lost/found item gets a unique transaction ID.

. Automatic Rewards – Lost item owners can set STX token rewards that are automatically transferred to finders.

. Secure Contact Info – Personal data is encrypted and stored securely.

. Modern Frontend – Responsive UI with animations, gradients, and smooth transitions.

. (Future Upgrade) Geolocation + IPFS integration for item photos.

* Tech Stack
Frontend

HTML5 – Page structure

CSS3 + Tailwind-inspired design – Modern styling, glassmorphism effects

Bootstrap 4 – Responsive grid & UI components

JavaScript + jQuery – Interactive behavior

Blockchain Integration

Stacks Blockchain – dApp backend on Bitcoin security

Leather Wallet – Wallet connection & STX transactions

Smart Contract Simulation – Item registration, matching, and reward distribution

* How It Works

Report Lost Item

Connect wallet → Fill form → Transaction created → Stored on Stacks blockchain → Get unique transaction ID

Report Found Item

Connect wallet → Fill form → App checks blockchain for matches → If matched → Reward triggered

Reward System

Owner sets STX reward → Smart contract automatically transfers tokens to finder

* Future Improvements

-> Real Stacks.js integration for actual blockchain transactions

-> Enhanced matching algorithm (fuzzy search / similarity detection)

-> Image uploads stored on IPFS

-> Geolocation mapping for lost/found items  
-> Geolocation mapping for lost/found items
